#The guest_list function reads in a list of tuples with the name, age, and profession of each party guest, 
#and prints the sentence "Guest is X years old and works as __." for each one.

		    print('{} is {} years old and works as {}'.format(i[0],i[1],i[2]))   #Using format method to place the arguments from list of tuples and then calling them using index
